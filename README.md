## To Start Exploring My Website
1. Fork my repository if you want to do edits.
2. Click Clone or download on my repository [Restaurant-Delivery-Website](https://github.com/GamingWithShaurya/Restaurant-Delivery-Website)
3. Locate [HOME.html](HOME.html) file in your pc and open it with a `webkit-scrollbar` supporting browser.
4. All the tabs to other pages should be at top.

If you try to check the [login](login.html) and [signup](SignUp.html) pages then you can freely do. This doesn't contain php or any tracker or data gatherer and it just reloads the site and doesnt send any data so don't feel afraid to try effects on the title bars of it.
